# 4GÃ†MERS Project Topic: Online shopping for Gamers.

Problem Definition: Gamers couldn't find the content they wanted to buy in-game in one area. Also there was not a safe shopping environment and account safety. Gamers should be able to easily find what they want while shopping. Therefore we have made a website that will satisfy these requests of gamers.

Solution Outline: We have designed an interface where users can easily access what they want. We have also added in-game products for common games.

Process Model: Unified Process.

Technologies to be used: Visual studio, MSQL, Html, CSS, Node.js, ASP.NET core.

Similar Projects: User interfaces are very complex in similar projects so the user can hardly get what he wants. They are also limited in terms of product variety. Example;G2A,ByNoGame. Conclusion: We have done a good project in a short time with a good team work and we have gained more knowledge in the technologies we use. In general, we have achieved the objectives of our project. However we couldn't complete some of the things we wanted in our project. The things we did not complete do not prevent our progress.

Future Works: Account verification by email will be brought in when the user signs up. Also payment transactions will be realized with 3D security system and Product diversity will be increased.
